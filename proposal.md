# Project Proposal - Github Actions

## Group Members
* Simon Gutenbrunner
* Christina Hager
* Emma Kiemeyer

## Proposal
The Group Project is a simple containerized Calculator Web Application that aims to demonstrate a neat development workflow using Github Actions.
The development environment is set up in such a way so it supports the automatic generation of documentation, and CI/CD.
Using the git flow principle, the repo automatically runs all unit tests and shows the user the the test results.
Additionally the repo builds a new container image containing the newly implemented features and automatically deploys it on docker hub.
